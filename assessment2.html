<p>Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara; 5 September 1946 – 24 November 1991)[2] was a British singer-songwriter, record producer and lead vocalist of the rock band Queen. He is regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of popular music,[3] and was known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-octave vocal range.[4][5][3]</p>

Mercury was born in Zanzibar to Parsi parents from India. After growing up in Zanzibar and then India, his family moved to Middlesex, England, in his late teens. He formed Queen in 1970 with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor. Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Killer Queen", "Somebody to Love", "Don't Stop Me Now", "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", and "We Are the Champions". He also led a solo career and served as a producer and guest musician for other artists. Mercury died in 1991 at age 45 due to complications from AIDS, having confirmed the day before his death that he had contracted the disease.

As a member of Queen, Mercury was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. In 1992, a year after his death, he was awarded the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music, and a tribute concert was held at Wembley Stadium, London. In 2002, he placed number 58 in the BBC's 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. The 2018 film about Mercury and Queen, Bohemian Rhapsody, is the highest-grossing musical biographical film of all time.

Early life
The house in Zanzibar where Mercury lived in his early years
</p><p>
Mercury was born Farrokh Bulsara in Stone Town in the British protectorate of Zanzibar on 5 September 1946.[6][7] His parents, Bomi (1908–2003) and Jer (1922–2016) Bulsara,[a][8] were Parsis from the Gujarat region of the then-province of the Bombay Presidency in British India.[b][9] They had moved to Zanzibar so that Bomi could continue his job as a cashier at the British Colonial Office. As Parsis, the Bulsara family practised the Zoroastrian religion.[10] Mercury had a younger sister called Kashmira.[11] He was born with four supernumerary incisors, to which he attributed his enhanced vocal range.[12] Mercury was born a British citizen, and remained so throughout his life.[13]

Mercury spent most of his childhood in India and began taking piano lessons at the age of seven.[14] In 1954, at the age of eight, Mercury was sent to study at St. Peter's School, a British-style boarding school for boys, in Panchgani near Bombay.[13] At the age of 12, he formed a school band, the Hectics, and covered rock and roll artists such as Cliff Richard and Little Richard.[15][16] One of Mercury's former bandmates from the Hectics has said "the only music he listened to, and played, was Western pop music."[17] A friend from the time recalls that he had "an uncanny ability to listen to the radio and replay what he heard on piano".[18] It was also at St. Peter's where he began to call himself "Freddie". He also attended St. Mary's School, Mumbai.[19] In February 1963 he moved back to Zanzibar where he joined his parents at their flat.[20]

Following graduation, Mercury joined a series of bands and sold second-hand clothes in Kensington Market in London with girlfriend Mary Austin. He also held a job as a baggage handler at Heathrow Airport.[23] Friends from the time remember him as a quiet and shy young man with a great interest in music.[24] In 1969 he joined the Liverpool-based band Ibex, later renamed</p>
